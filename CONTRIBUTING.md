  ## Coding Style Guidelines

  Welcome to our project! We value your contributions and aim to make 
  collaboration enjoyable and productive. To maintain code consistency and 
  readability, we ask all contributors to strictly adhere to the following 
  style guidelines.

  ### Indentation and Formatting

  - **Indentation**: Use two spaces for indentation, not tabs.
  - **Line Length**: Ensure that no line of code exceeds 77 characters, 
    including whitespace.
  - **Brackets**: Place opening brackets on the same line as the statement 
    and closing brackets on a new line.

  ### Naming Conventions

  - **Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase for naming variables and 
    functions.
  - **Classes**: Class names should start with an uppercase letter and 
    follow camelCase.

  ### Type Hinting

  - All functions must include explicit type hints.
  - Specify types for parameters and return values.

  ```python
  def exampleFunction(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    # Function implementation
  ```

  ### Docstrings

  - **Mandatory Docstrings**: Every function and class must have a docstring. 
    The specific format and style of docstrings will be further specified in 
    future guidelines.

  ### Commit Messages

  - Write clear, concise commit messages in the imperative mood.

  Thank you for contributing to our project! By following these guidelines, we 
  can ensure a harmonious and efficient collaborative environment.
